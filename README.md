## docker environments

This repository has several configurations of docker environments (Dockerfile or docker-compose).

The purpose of these preconfigured environments is to facilitate the development in several languages ​​as well as several servers (node, ngynx, etc).

These environments are also already available in docker image format in my Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=vj21&type=image)
